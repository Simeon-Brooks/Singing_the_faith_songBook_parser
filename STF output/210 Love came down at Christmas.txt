Verse 1 (/3)
Love came down at Christmas,
Love all lovely, Love divine;
Love was born at Christmas,
star and angels gave the sign.

Verse 2 (/3)
Worship we the Godhead,
Love incarnate, Love divine;
worship we our Jesus:
but wherewith for sacred sign?

Verse 3 (/3)
Love shall be our token,
love be yours and love be mine,
love to God and all the world,
love for plea and gift and sign.
