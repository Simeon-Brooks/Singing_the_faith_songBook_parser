1   Love came down at Christmas,
    Love all lovely, Love divine;
    Love was born at Christmas,
    star and angels gave the sign.

2   Worship we the Godhead,
    Love incarnate, Love divine;
    worship we our Jesus:
    but wherewith for sacred sign?

3   Love shall be our token,
    love be yours and love be mine,
    love to God and all the world,
    love for plea and gift and sign.


Christina Georgina Rossetti (1830-1894)
