1   Once in royal David's city
    stood a lowly cattle shed,
    where a mother laid her baby
    in a manger for his bed:
    Mary was that mother mild,
    Jesus Christ her little child.

2   He came down to earth from heaven
    who is God and Lord of all,
    and his shelter was a stable,
    and his cradle was a stall;
    with the needy, poor and lowly
    lived on earth our Saviour holy.

3   And our eyes at last shall see him,
    through his own redeeming love,
    for that child so dear and gentle
    is our Lord in heaven above;
    and he leads his children on
    to the place where he is gone.

4   Not in that poor lowly stable,
    with the oxen standing by,
    we shall see him;but in heaven,
    set at God's right hand on high;
    there his children gather round
    bright like stars, with glory crowned.
