1   Unto us a boy is born!
    King of all creation,
    came he to a world forlorn,
    the Lord of every nation.

2   Cradled in a stall was he
    with sleepy cows and asses;
    but the very beasts could see
    that he all folk surpasses.

3   Herod then with fear was filled:
    'A prince,' he said, 'in Jewry!'
    All the little boys he killed
    at Bethlem in his fury.

4   Now may Mary's son, who came
    so long ago to love us,
    lead us all with hearts aflame
    unto the joys above us.

5   Omega and Alpha he!
    Let the organ thunder,
    while the choir with peals of glee
    now rends the air asunder.
