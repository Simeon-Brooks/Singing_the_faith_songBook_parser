1   See, amid the winter's snow,
    born for us on earth below,
    see, the Lamb of God appears,
    promised from eternal years!
      Hail, the ever-blessed morn!
      Hail, redemption's happy dawn!
      Sing through all Jerusalem:
      Christ is born in Bethlehem!

2   Lo, within a manger lies
    he who built the starry skies,
    he who, throned in height sublime,
    sits amid the cherubim!

3   Say, you holy shepherds, say,
    what your joyful news today;
    why then have you left your sheep
    on the lonely mountain steep?

4   'As we watched at dead of night,
    lo, we saw a wondrous light:
    angels, singing "Peace on earth,"
    told us of the Saviour's birth.'

5   Sacred infant, holy child,
    tender love so pure and mild
    comes from heaven's highest bliss
    down to such a world as this!


Edward Caswall (1814-1878)
