1   O come, all ye faithful,
    joyful and triumphant,
    O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;
    come and behold him,
    born the King of angels:
      O come, let us adore him,
      O come, let us adore him,
      O come, let us adore him, Christ the Lord!

2   True God of true God,
    Light of Light eternal,
    lo, he abhors not the Virgin's womb;
    Son of the Father,
    begotten, not created:

3   See how the shepherds,
    summoned to his cradle,
    leaving their flocks, draw nigh to gaze;
    we too will thither
    bend our joyful footsteps:

4   Lo, star-led chieftains,
    Magi, Christ adoring,
    offer him incense, gold, and myrrh;
    we to the Christ-child
    bring our hearts' oblations:

5   Sing, choirs of angels,
    sing in exultation,
    sing, all ye citizens of heaven above:
    'Glory to God
    in the highest:'

* 6    Yea, Lord, we greet thee,
    born this happy morning,
    Jesus, to thee be glory given:
    Word of the Father,
    now in flesh appearing:


Latin, 18th century, possibly by
John Francis Wade (c. 1711-1786)
and others

  * The final verse should be sung only on Christmas Day.
