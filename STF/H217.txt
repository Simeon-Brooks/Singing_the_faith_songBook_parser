1   Silent night, holy night:
    sleeps the world;hid from sight,
    Mary and Joseph in stable bare
    watch o'er the child beloved and fair
    sleeping in heavenly rest.

2   Silent night, holy night:
    shepherds first saw the light,
    heard resounding clear and long,
    far and near, the angel-song:
    'Christ the Redeemer is here!'

3   Silent night, holy night:
    Son of God, O how bright
    love is smiling from your face!
    Strikes for us now the hour of grace,
    Jesus, Lord at your birth.
