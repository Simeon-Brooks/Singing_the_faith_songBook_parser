1   O little town of Bethlehem,
    how still we see thee lie!
    Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
    the silent stars go by.
    Yet in thy dark streets shineth
    the everlasting light;
    the hopes and fears of all the years
    are met in thee tonight.

2   O morning stars, together
    proclaim the holy birth,
    and praises sing to God the King,
    and peace to all the earth!
    For Christ is born of Mary;
    and, gathered all above,
    while mortals sleep, the angels keep
    their watch of wondering love.

3   How silently, how silently,
    the wondrous gift is given!
    So God imparts to human hearts
    the blessings of his heaven.
    No ear may hear his coming;
    but in this world of sin,
    where meek souls will receive him still
    the dear Christ enters in.

4   O holy Child of Bethlehem,
    descend to us, we pray;
    cast out our sin, and enter in;
    be born in us today!
    We hear the Christmas angels
    the great glad tidings tell;
    O come to us, abide with us,
    our Lord Immanuel!


Phillips Brooks (1835-1893)
